# Temporary-File-Cleaner

By clearing temp files from time to time, you can gain back a lot of C drive space. Here're is the program to delete temporary files in Windows 10.

In a day to day operation Microsoft creates several temp files and stores them in various system folders. These temporary files are quite useful and allow the system to function efficiently and faster. However, over time these temporary files can build up to an extent where they consume several GBs worth of space in your C drive. For instance, last time I scanned my system, Windows 10 is using over 6 GB to store temporary files. This is in addition to the reserved storage. If you think that's too much, use this program below to delete all your Temp Files 


Simple Steps To Use the program 
Download the "Zip" file of this program 
And Just run the Temp_clean.bat file to clean all your Junk Files
